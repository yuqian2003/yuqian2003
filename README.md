### Abstract
Tabular data learning has gained significant attention in the field of deep learning due to its wide applicability. However, existing embedding techniques face limitations when dealing with numerical and categorical features, such as the inability to capture complex relationships and the need for laborious feature engineering. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep embedding framework for tabular data. The framework leverages lightweight deep neural networks to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and generality of feature embeddings. For numerical features, a two-step feature expansion and deep transformation technique is introduced to capture richer semantic information. For categorical features, we generate a unique identification vector for each entity using a small lookup table, then employ a parameterized deep embedding function to standardize the dimensions to a uniform embedding size, and finally transform the identification vector into the final embedding vector using a deep neural network. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed framework’s performance. The proposed framework provides a unified solution for end-to-end training without the need for extensive feature engineering, which contributes to the advancement of tabular data learning in machine learning research.
